        <p><em>Creator of things big, small, serious, quirky, real, fantastic and funny. Firm believer that we are all <strong>created</strong> to <strong>create</strong>. We are all <strong>co-creators</strong> of our reality.</em></p>
        <p>If I absolutely had to describe myself (and I can't think of a really good reason why I would have to), I would say I am an artist. I make art with food, with metal, with earth, with words, with my voice, and with every other resource available
          to me in the moment. I love to create. I live to create.</p></td>
